# Idle-Fabric-Game
 Factory simulation game
<br/>
In this game where you have a clothing factory, you hire employees and sell clothes automatically. You can double your money by trading on the stock market. You can borrow money from the bank and grow your factory by buying yourself new warehouses and you will get closer to a realistic factory product sales experience with many more newly added features.(Still Under Development)
